The Test Task
The test task is expected to take a minimum of 8 hours to complete.
What to Build?
Create a simple user list page using Next.js 15 (stable version) with Server-Side Rendering (SSR). The page should display a list of users, be optimized for SEO, and meet basic WCAG accessibility standards.
Tech Requirements
Frontend:
Build the page using Next.js 15 with SSR.
User List:
Display a list of users with names and short descriptions. Use static data (e.g., a JSON file) for the users.
SEO Optimization:
Implement dynamic <title> and <meta name="description"> tags.
Ensure the page is crawlable by search engines (SSR ensures this).
WCAG Compliance:
Use semantic HTML (e.g., proper <h1>, <ul>, etc.).
Add alt text to any images (if included).
Ensure basic keyboard navigation support (e.g., focus states).
Performance:
Optimize for fast load times (e.g., use Next.js’s <Image> component with lazy loading if images are included)
Submission
Share your public GitHub repository containing all the code.
Include a README with:
Clear instructions to build and run the app locally.
A brief explanation of how you implemented SEO optimizations and WCAG compliance.
